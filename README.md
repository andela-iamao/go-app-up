### Go App Up
A simple GoLang command line tool for getting notified if a website is down.

### Why?
To reduce manually having to check if a website is up and go be immediately notified if its down.

### How to install
The installation is super simple, open up your terminal and run the following commands:
```
$ bash ./setup.sh
```

### How to use it
Open up your terminal and enter:
`go-app-up`
you will get prompted by something like this
`$ Enter website(s):`
Enter the website you want to monitor(e.g: `http://google.com`) or you can enter multiple links,
separating them by a comma(,)(e.g `http://google.com, http://exists.not`)
Sit back and let the tool work away. You will get a notification if it encounters a down time.
